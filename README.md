# codenamesRPC
discord RPC for the webbrowser game codenames
i was planning on adding a way to view the role of the player as well but i cant find an easy way to do so


- Explanation:
a node server runs locally and starts the discord RPC, via an extention in the browser information about the game is then sent to the server and embeded into the activity

i couldnt make the extention public because google wanted me to pay $5
(if youre wondering the warning is because chrome will stop supporting manifest v2 this year)

after installing the extention into chrome and then running the codenames.exe it should update your discord RPC every 20 seconds as you play codenames


- Installation:
this app is currenly only supported for windows with chrome

installing the extention:
0: unzip the extention file
1. manage your chrome extentions at "chrome://extensions"
2. turn on "developer mode" at the right top
3. click "load unpacked"
4. select the unzipped extention folder
